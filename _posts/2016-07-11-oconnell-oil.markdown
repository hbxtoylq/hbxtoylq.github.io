description:  I built two versions of websites for O'Connell Oil. For the first version, I was provided with Adobe Photoshop PSD design files. I developed a pixel perfect and fully functional website with PHP, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript based on those design files . One year later, I rebuilt the website with WordPress. I installed and configured WordPress, customized theme, researched and installed and configured various modules, set up different access levels for different users so that each department can take care of their own business. I wrote detailed user manual and provided training to several employees so that they can use the system and update the website.<br><br> <button name="button2" onclick="window.open('http://www.oconnelloil.com/')"> View Site</button>
