description: This is a volunteer project that I have done for Crocker Farm Elementary School Parent and Guardian Organization (PGO). The PGO chair told me that they needed a website that was easy to use and maintain. They hoped that the contents on their website and the posts on their Facebook can be synced automatically. No matter where they post the information, both Facebook and the website will be updated. They also use Mailchimp to send out e-newsletter to parents and families. They would like the new posts on the website can be automatically sent  to the parents and families regularly. Sometimes they will have fundraise events. They hope that they can sell items online. They wish this website is multilingual. <br><br> Based on their specifications,  I built two websites from ground up, the PGO blogger with WordPress and the PGO online store with Open Cart (the online store is discontinued). Following are the tasks that I have performed. <ul> <li>Worked through the full project lifecycle, including ideation, architecture, design, development, testing, release, and operation support</li><li>Researched available web host and domain registration options and made recommendations to PGO for affordable packages. Completed domain registration and set up web hosting.</li><li>Installed and configured WordPress for PGO blog. Created graphics and customized theme, found plugins that can be useful according to the requirements, installed and configured several plugins to deliver useful features</li> <li>Design and set up enewsletter in Mailchimp. Configured and integrated MailChimp with the PGO blog website to send out e-newsletter regularly</li><li>Installed and configured Open Cart for PGO online store. Created graphics and customized template, set up products in the store, configure payment methods</li> <li>Wrote detailed instructions and provided technical training to others so that they know how to update and maintain the website on their own. </li></ul><br> <button name="button2" onclick="window.open('http://pgocrockerfarm.com/')"> View Site</button>
