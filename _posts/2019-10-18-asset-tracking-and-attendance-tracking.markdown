description: I designed and developed a framework that is flexible and dynamic and can be used in multiple ways.  It is mobile responsive. The interface is dynamically generated based on the setup parameters. Each department that uses this application will have its own unique and customized interface. This website is rich and complex in functionalities. It can be used to track assets assignments to a group or individual people with various photo ID, it can also be used to track attendance for different events. The website has front end interface and administration interface, the users will have access based on their access roles and levels. Through the front end interface, the regular user can use the application to check in and check out attendees if the event is set up to track attendance, if the event is set up to track assets, the regular user can use the application to  assign, collect assets to individual person, or do bulk asset management to groups.  In the administration area, the administrators can  set up events, run reports, load data, and manage users, sessions and locations. This application has been used all year around by several departments for different purposes, such as Human Resource Trainings Attendance Tracking, Wellness Fair Attendance Tracking, and UMass Outing Club Gear Rental Tracking.  <br><br>I have worked through all phases of this project.
