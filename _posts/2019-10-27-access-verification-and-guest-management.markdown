description: I designed and developed the Access Verification and Guest Management web application. This website is rich in functionalities and complex in logic. It integrates data resources from  multiple existing systems (Student and Restriction Data from SPIRE, Card Access System from CCURE, and Trespass Data from Police Department). The website has front end interface and administration interface, the users will have access based on their access roles and levels. Through the front end interface, security staff will check in or check out residents and guests, either by swiping their UMass UCard, drive license or by looking up their names. This web application manages residents and visitors and improves enforcement on visitors with judicial bans, trespass notices or campus sanctions. In the administration area, there are features to let administrator view and generate all kinds of reports, manage users access, set guest policy regarding guest limits per person/per living unit for specific time frame, set up events, add restrictions or trespass records, set up special housing records. On the web server, there are multiple cron jobs set up, cron jobs to import data from different data sources into this system, cron jobs to run hourly reports and daily reports and auto check out. This system is flexible, it is fully customized based on the processes and policies set by UMass Amherst. This website is used by Residential Hall Security Team every night in 52 residential halls, all year around. It has provided great value in improving UMass Amherst campus security. <br><br>I have worked through all phases of this project. I built the entire website from ground up.
