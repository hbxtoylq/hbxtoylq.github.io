description: This website was hosted in Amazon Cloud. I installed Apache/MySQL/PHP/WordPress and configured the web server through the Amazon Web Service EC2. For this project, I was provided some Photoshop PSD design files. After analyzing the interfaces, I created the database tables in MySQL, developed the entire website  with PHP, HTML, CSS, BootStrap, MySQL, JavaScript, jQuery, Ajax and transferred the designs into dynamic functional websites.  This website was rich in functionalities, people can register through the website, the administrator can verify the legibility of the registered members; verified members can view the member directory after successfully log in. There was password recovery feature if the user forgot their password. This website had responsive design for desktop website and mobile website. I wrote codes to detect which platform that the user is using and presenting with corresponding website.  <br><br> <button name="button2" onclick="window.open('http://vusweb.org/')"> View Site</button>
