description: I joined Mass Green Initiative since its inception. It was STCCâ€™s hub for green energy education and outreach. I built two websites to promote its mission. One website was built with WordPress, which provided green career guidance and connected people to resources, the other website was built with Drupal and accessible to authorized users who discussed course trainings. The websites were hosted in a virtue private server through Liquid web hosting. In nearly two and half years, as the only web master for these two websites, I had been in charge of every aspect of them,  from domain registration to web hosting, from requirement analysis to end user training, from graphic design to content writing, from database design to web coding, from data reporting to user management, from search engine optimization to social media marketing.
